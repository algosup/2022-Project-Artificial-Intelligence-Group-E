# 2022-Project-Artificial-Intelligence-Group-E

The goal of the project is to build a device that can listen to conversations (in project rooms for instance) and detect when English is spoken or when French is spoken. The device could emit a sound or display different colors based on the language.

Project realized with:
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a code editor.
- [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) programming language on Visual Studio Code.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), the leading open source library for developing and training machine learning models.
- [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index), a free online cloud based Jupyter notebook environment that allows us to train our machine learning and deep learning models.
