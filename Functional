1 / Project Description

The goal of the project is to do a device that can recognize the language of people speaking around it , 
speaking in English or in French. We can also imagine something like a led which becomes red or green 
when the device hears the user speaks in a language and makes the difference between the both.

2 / Data Ressources

On the internet there are a lot of different ways to collect data , by videos but also just by mp3 files 
like podcasts or interviews . The difference between them it’s that the language can be specific to a domain 
when they speak about something so we need to see what data we want.

-Podcast

We could collect data from podcasts , generally the podcastor speak clearly and use expressions , so it 
can be a good idea to take data from that.

-Dataset Search

It’s something done by google to search data , audio ,text. There is a lot of information on it ,
and it can be really useful if we are looking for something specific.

-Audio Book

Audio books can be a good thing because they generally use words that are not generally used , 
so it can bring data we will find nowhere.

3 / Privacy

The first idea to make something private is to not connect the device to a network. 
It’s the best answer to make something secure.
