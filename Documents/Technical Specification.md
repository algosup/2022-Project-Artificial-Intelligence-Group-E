### What/When/Why

This project needs to be done in 9 weeks , the objective is to create a device that can detect the language people are speaking. In Algosups case, we are mainly focused on French and English, to avoid students who are speaking French during class or project time.

### Background

One of the main objective of Algosup is to make students speaking English while they are in class, the more you speak the more you will learn. The idea is to make students speak English during their breaks, the lunch time and also the more important during the project time. So the idea came up. How to make them speak only in English during their project time without having to come in their room each hour ?

### Goals

The goal of this project is to create a device, which is able to detect if the people around are speaking French or English, and be able to warn the user around if they speak in the wrong language.

### Non-Goals

We cancelled the idea of using an Arduino device , due to a lack of storage on the Arduino device, which was not enough for us to be able to do an efficient model with the free space on it.

### Plan

### Measuring Impact

### Security, Privacy, Risks

The first risk, is that the accuracy of the model will be too low and the device won't work well.

For the privacy, the audio file will be transformed into an image, we store the image while it is replaced by the next one.
