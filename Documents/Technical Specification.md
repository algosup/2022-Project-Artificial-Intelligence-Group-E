### What/When/Why

This project needs to be done in 9 weeks , the objective is to create a device that can detect the language people are speaking. In Algosups case, we are mainly focused on French and English, to avoid students who are speaking French during class or project time.

### Background

One of the main objective of Algosup is to make students speaking English while they are in class, the more you speak the more you will learn. The idea is to make students speak English during their breaks, the lunch time and also the more important during the project time. So the idea came up. How to make them speak only in English during their project time without having to come in their room each hour ?

### Goals

The goal of this project is to create a device, which is able to detect if the people around are speaking French or English, and be able to warn the user around if they speak in the wrong language.

### Non-Goals

We cancelled the idea of using an Arduino device , due to a lack of storage on the Arduino device, which was not enough for us to be able to do an efficient model with the free space on it.

### Plan
 - Week 1
 
During the first week , the objectives will be to do the documents and find information about IA and how we'll succed in this project

 - Weeks 2 and 3

After , we'll take 2 weeks to find a databases that we can use and also find the best format that we needed.


 - Weeks 4 ,  5 and  6

For the weeks 4 , 5 and 6 , we'll look for the best solutions to process the data , what kind of data we'll use to train the data and 
which one was the best for our utiliti

 - Weeks 7 and 8

During the weeks 7 and 8 , we'll to the time to find the best model and also to setup the device to be able to use the model
and detect the voice.

 - Week 9

The last week we'll take the time to prepare the presentation and depend of how the project will be but maybe 
change some things that don't work.

### Measuring Impact

### Security, Privacy, Risks

The first risk, is that the accuracy of the model will be too low and the device won't work well.

For the privacy, the audio file will be transformed into an image, we store the image while it is replaced by the next one.

### Other Considerations
